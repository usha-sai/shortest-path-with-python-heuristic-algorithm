# shortest-path-with-python-heuristic-algorithm
find the shortest path with a heuristic algorithm in python

# I have created a class that represents each cell in the pygame screen

# I have created a custom code to ask the user to enter starting and ending points

# After we have entered the starting and ending points we can create blocks between the starting and ending points which will be block the way to reach from the starting and ending point

# I have created a main() function that finds the shortest path between two cells
